        <p>This frequently occurs at movie theatres, which got us to thinking about <span class="bold-text">how we can make it simple for people to find and book movie tickets to prevent stress and delays during peak movie-going hours.</span></p>

        <p>Reel is a cinema app that helps users locate nearby cinemas in their area, and make ticket bookings, snack purchases, and seat reservations all in one place to save users the stress and delays involved in making physical bookings at cinemas. The app's main aim is to provide a stressless cinema booking experience.</p>
        <p class="big-text">It all began as a personal experience that I gradually became aware of, and when I ran into a startup with the same business idea, I was eager to take on the challenge.</p>

        <p>Having identified the project goal, I needed to understand the real-time issues surrounding ticket bookings and seat reservations in cinemas. I spoke to a couple of individuals at a cinema asking about their feelings and thoughts around ticket, snacks and seat booking in exchange for a drink for their time.  Then i conducted an online survey with 20 individuals who like to visit cinemas frequently with the aim of gaining insight into the experience and challenges of making cinema reservations.</p>

        <p class="light-gray average">Measured based on initial user feedbacks.</p>
        <p>The design of our cinema app prioritizes ease of use and accessibility for all users. The clean and modern interface allows for quick and seamless navigation to find and purchase tickets and make seat reservations for upcoming films.</p>
        <p>To ensure that the app is accessible to all users, we have included high-contrast color schemes and larger text options for users with visual impairments. We also included voice commands to facilitate navigation for users with mobility impairments.</p>
        <p>User testing and feedback have been incredibly positive, with a significant increase in app engagement and ticket purchases. Our app's design has also received praise for its ability to cater to diverse user needs and preferences.</p>
        
        <p class="section-title">Reflection</p>
        <div class="flexbox">
            <p>This project helped me learn more about the importance of research to the design process as it guides every design decision made. I did a lot of iteration in the process and it also helped me realize the importance of user testing at every step.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Moving forward,</span> I would like to incorporate more accessibility features to ensure that the app is useful for a wider range of users. Also, I’d like to conduct more usability testing to identify any area of difficulty and to see if the user’s needs are met.</p>
