        <p class="section-title">Simplifying the travel planning process</p>
        <p>Exploring new places and going on trips has to be one of the most exciting aspects of life. Think about the last time you went on a vacation or trip; the planning process was probably not as smooth or simple as you'd hoped. Travel planning can be intimidating, particularly if you don't know much about the destination or know anyone who lives there.</p>
        <p>This was the starting point for thinking about how we could make journey planning a simplified and less stressful part of traveling.</p>

        <div class="gif-container"><img src="./images/travlr/Home-and-Discovery.gif" alt=""></div>
        <p>Travelr presents a new approach to solo or group trip planning through access to personalized travel information. Designing travelr was aimed at solving the tedious process involved in planning trips alone or as a group by providing access to travel guides, tourists spots, and other related information on the destination based on users’ interests, also itinerary planning either manually inputted or automatically generated through synced booking emails.</p>
        <p>The overall goal is to make travel planning a seamless and simplified process.</p>

        <p class="section-title">Defining the target users</p>
        <p>The target users were not clearly defined at the start of the project because I assumed it would not affect the design process, but I quickly found at the start of the research process that it would be critical to each step of the design process. The product vision was then used to define the target user as young people and adults who travel frequently or appreciate traveling.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section-four">
        <p class="section-title">Understanding the general feeling and thoughts toward travel planning.</p>
        <p>At the start of the process, I spoke to a friend who recently traveled and was sharing her experience about the planning process and how it was quite tedious considering it was a group trip. This conversation gave me an insight into the struggles experienced in trip planning, especially with group travel, so I had to speak to other travelers and people who’d like to travel to understand their travel planning expectations, experience, and their needs.</p>
        <p>To obtain this information, I did a virtual interview with 5 frequent travelers and a survey with 20 people who travel and some who haven't but are interested in doing so. I was interested in finding out about the process they typically go through when planning a trip, what difficulties they encounter, what changes they might make, and what expectations they have during the travel planning process and once they arrive at their destination.</p>

    <section class="section-five">
        <p class="section-title">Comparing Products in the market</p>
        <p>The insights I gained from the initial research phase about how people currently book and plan their travel led me to investigate existing products. I compared the functionalities, visual style, and user experience of four products: TripIt: Travel Planner, Wanderlog, Skyscanner, and Travelstart.</p>
        <div class="image-container"><img src="./images/travlr/Competitive-analysis.png" alt=""></div>
        <p>This phase gave a bit more direction on how the idea can be created taking into consideration the gaps and weaknesses identified in the competitors.</p>

        <p class="section-title">Representing user’s needs and points of view on the problem</p>
        <p>Using the data and insight gathered from the user research, I had to create a better representation of the targeted users to help guide the product direction and guide the decision-making process. I identified 2 categories and scenarios of travel planners as well as the unique pain points and goals for each user type.</p>

    <section class="section-seven">
        <p class="section-title">Aligning business goals and identified user needs</p>
        <p>Right after creating personas, I had some ideas on what an ideal solution would be, then I realized it was important to understand and align the ideas with the business vision and goals for the product. To effectively visualize this, I created a lean UX Canvas.</p>
        <div class="image-container"><img src="./images/travlr/lean2.png" alt=""></div>
        <p>The primary takeaway from this phase was aligning the business problem and expected outcomes to inform product direction, as well as taking into account identified user needs when crafting value propositions.</p>

    <section class="section-eight">
        <p class="section-title">Visualizing the users’ journey</p>
        <p>While I had a clear picture of the prospective users, I needed to use user stories to visualize their journey. This was done in a scenario where the product is being used in order to map out use cases, and identify potential edge cases and opportunities for product improvement.</p>
        <div class="image-container"><img src="./images/travlr/user-journey.png" alt=""></div>
        <p>This process helped me identify the various steps and opportunities that would be involved in the use of the product, so I needed a better visualization of how the app features and functions would flow in order to create a seamless experience. I created the flow chart noting data collection points in the process to help with the development.</p>

        <p class="section-title">Wireframing and Prototyping the Early Version</p>
        <p>Using the information architecture from the flow chart, I identified the pages and features required, so I drafted digital wireframes and created a prototype showing the functionalities and layout of the app content. This was to easily iterate on the layout and also get early feedback through usability testing.</p>

        <p class="section-title margin-top">Testing, first phase</p>
        <p>While wireframing the trip plan page, i had 2 ideas for the layout which i designed and in order to validate the choice of one, i conducted an unmoderated A/B Testing using maze to understand user’s perspective on each.</p>

        <p class="bold-text">This led to an iteration to fit better usability and improve overall experience.</p>

        <p class="section-title margin-top">Visual design guide</p>
        <p>After refining the low-fidelity designs, I started to create a style guide and system to guide the visual design process.</p>
        <p>The primary color, a gradient with a mix of orange and pink was chosen to give an exciting feel to the app, as it is involved in the early phase of a travel experience. The font family, Manrope was also chosen for clear readability and also to portray a slightly playful and friendly feel as a result of the rounded edges of the typefaces.</p>

        <p class="section-title">Onboarding and personalizing experience</p>
        <p>The onboarding experience for new users was designed to inform them of the ways they can achieve their trip planning goals in 3 swipes, they also get to select some of their interests so that they get suggestions tailored to their interests.</p>
        <div class="gif-container"><img src="./images/travlr/Onboarding-and-personalizing-exp.gif" alt=""></div>

        <p class="section-title">Home and Discovery</p>
        <p>Getting into the app, the homepage is structured in a way that provides suggestions on trip destinations based on each user’s interest, there are travel guides, bucket list activities also based on the users’ interests. There’s a search box that would help to easily search a place and get relevant information.</p>
        <div class="gif-container"><img src="./images/travlr/Home-and-Discovery.gif" alt=""></div>

        <p class="section-title">Planning a new trip</p>
        <p>The process of planning trips could easily become scattered and exhausting as observed from the research phase. To make this a well-streamlined process, the user starts a new trip plan by inputting basic key details to set up the planning process, they also get to add friends as collaborators and set trip budgets.</p>
        <div class="gif-container"><img src="./images/travlr/Planning-a-new-trip.gif" alt=""></div>

        <p class="section-title">Setting up and exploring the trip plan</p>
        <p>Once the trip plan is initially set up, the sections make the planning process easy by making important information based on the travel destination easily accessible. This includes the explore section showing booking and travel information tailored to the destination, a trip plan containing itinerary, notes, and booking details; the budget section where expenses can be allocated among collaborators</p>

        <p>On completion of the high fidelity designs, i conducted a moderated usability study involving 7 participants remotely using maze.

        <p class="section-title">Conclusion :)</p>
        <p>This project was a very exciting one for me because it involved and combined some of my favorite things [travel, exploration, and user experience]. I enjoyed the research and design phase, understanding the issues and fears people have around planning trips then crafting a solution to those issues.  Going forward, I plan to conduct further usability tests to ensure the app features are easily accessible and useful for users.</p>
