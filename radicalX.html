        <p class="section-title purple-text">Project background</p>
        <p>As a student and early-career professional, I was eager to find my ideal job but had no idea where to begin. That's when I discovered RadicalX, a platform that connects people like me with innovative companies through Virtual Internship Programs. I got to work at RadicalX, eager to contribute to the amazing work being done there.</p>
        <p>During my time there, I worked with a team to create a feature for the product- a career assessment website to help students, early career professionals, and professionals transitioning easily make a tech career choice and provide them with resources to get started in their career choice.</p>
        <p>While this part of the product is still in the works, you can view the website we created so far</p>

        <p class="section-title purple-text">Getting into the problem identified and the project goal</p>
        <p>A lot of times at the start of a person’s career or transition into the tech industry, there’s always the question of “what career do I get started in?” leading to a period of confusion and random sampling of multiple tech careers. This formed a baseline for the project.</p>
        <p class="bold-text big-text">How might we help students, early career professionals and professionals transitioning discover their career path easily?</p>
        <!-- <p>This project aimed to design a career assessment website to help students, early career professionals, and professionals transitioning easily make a tech career choice and provide them with resources to get started in their career choice.</p> -->

        <p class="section-title purple-text">Approaching the problem: Design Kick-off</p>
        <p>The project brief was very exciting but was a bit ambiguous as well in terms of coming up with the assessment questions, and gaining a high level of knowledge of the problem. So to kick off the project we decided on a UX strategy to guide our process and sprints.</p>
        <div class="image-container"><img src="./images/radicalX/Roadmap.png" alt=""></div>
        
        <p class="section-title purple-text">User analysis and Initial research</p>
        <p>Starting, we had already defined the “who” of the product as students, early career professionals, and professionals transitioning into tech. I lead the research team to define <span class="bold-text">the goals for the research</span> to understand the struggles of making a tech career choice, discover what motivates and influences the target audience to find a tech career path, Identify current means for discovering/launching tech careers and the challenges encountered in the process.</p>
        <p>Since RadicalX already had a ton of users, we interviewed about 10 existing users trying to understand their struggles then we also surveyed about 20 of them to get data on issues relating to deciding on a tech career.</p>
        <p>From the research, we were able to identify themes and patterns in the responses gathered by sorting them into motivations, needs, pain points and goals.</p>
        
        <div class="image-container"><img src="./images/radicalX/Secondary research findings.png" alt=""></div>

        <p class="section-title">Gathering more data on the career assessment process</p>
        <p>After gaining some insight from the targeted audience, we conducted secondary research to understand the current solutions to helping people decide on a career path that is most suited for them and to identify ways to make it a more enjoyable and engaging process.</p>
        <p>To get this information, we carried out desk research on effective quiz methods and competitive analysis on 8 direct and indirect competitors checking through their reviews and assessment experiences. These were the key findings from the desk research-</p>
        <div class="image-container"><img src="./images/radicalX/Secondary research findings(2).png" alt=""></div>

        <p>The <span class="bold-text">competitive analysis was done in the form of a SWOT analysis</span> comparing key features across the competitors. The direct competitors include Career Explorer, Princeton Review, 123Test.com, and CareerFitter and the indirect competitors include thinkful, Career Karma, Springboard, and Entry Level.</p>
        <div class="image-container"><img src="./images/radicalX/SWOT.png" alt=""></div>
        
        <p class="section-title">Identifying business goals and problem statements.</p>
        <p>Starting on the project, we didn’t have a clear vision for the business goal so after getting data from the research phase we could identify the business goal to be an <span class="bold-text">increase in the virtual internship participants through an informed decision from the career assessment feature.</span></p>
        <p>The data from the secondary research also helped us craft problem statements from the users’ perspective giving a clearer statement of the problem to be solved.</p>
        <p class="bold-text italics">“Students, early career professionals, and professionals transitioning into tech all face difficulties, intimidation, and a lack of resources to make the right tech career choice.”</p>

        <p class="section-pretitle">Persona development</p>
        <p class="section-title">Who would be using the feature?</p>
        <p>Using the data gathered from the research and our existing knowledge of the target users for the feature, we created a persona telling the user groups' stories, pain points, and goals. This helped us as a reference point for empathizing with the users.</p>

    <section class="section-three">
        <p class="section-title">Understanding the user’s story and mapping their journey for improvement</p>
        <p>The early tech career stage of a large number of people is characterized by confusion in selecting a best-fit career path and this was shown in the details on the personas created, so we needed a concise statement showing the goal and motivations of the users to guide our design decisions. I led the process of creating the user stories and journey mapping.</p>
        <div class="image-container"><img src="./images/radicalX/User stories.png" alt=""></div>
        <p>The stories inspired the creation of a journey map to identify what the process of taking the career assessment would look like, helping us identify areas to improve the experience and the major touchpoints for the product</p>
        <div class="image-container"><img src="./images/radicalX/User Journey Map.png" alt=""></div>

        <p class="section-title">Identifying the business value proposition</p>
        <p>With the user story and a better understanding of the user needs in hand, we used a Value Proposition Canvas to determine what all of these needs meant for RadicalX as a business. We identified the product value created by the career quiz and linked it to customer needs.</p>
        <p>In this process, we clarified the tasks that the user would be able to complete with our product. By linking the user needs to the value proposition, stakeholder alignment was facilitated, ensuring that the needs of all parties involved were met. This process stimulated a well-curated user experience and provides RadicalX an advantage over its competitors.</p>

        <p class="section-title">How could the career assessment work?</p>
        <p>The value map gave more insight into how the feature would work and stand out from others; then It was time to start crafting the product through the sitemap, considering incorporating personalized journeys for each user group. This helped us identify the simplest way to organize information on the website and also possible edge cases in the design. I led the team through this process.</p>

    <section class="section-four">
        <p class="section-title">Getting started on the design</p>
        <p>We started working on the interface using all of the insights on the career assessment process and questions. We created mid-fidelity wireframes and prototypes to show the structure for the assessment, present it to stakeholders, and conduct an early version test. We made multiple iterations based on feedback from the stakeholders.</p>
        <div class="gif-container"><img src="./images/radicalX/RadicalX_Wireframe.gif" alt=""></div>

        <p class="section-title">Testing… 1,2</p>
        <p>Due to time constraints, we were only able to conduct unmoderated usability tests with 5 participants for the wireframes. Our focus was on how participants felt about the length of the assessment as well as the impact of the UX copy. (Assessment questions)</p>

        <p class="section-title">Key Findings</p>
        <div class="flexbox">
            <div>
                <p class="dark-grey">From the participants:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The participants found the site easy to navigate and straight to the point.</li>
                    <li>They found the content on the assessment result page to be very helpful.</li>
                    <li>3 out of 5 of the participants found the assessment to be lengthy</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class="dark-grey">From the Stakeholders:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The stakeholders found the structure of the website to be good but suggested a more engaging approach to asking questions so as not to bore the users with a lengthy assessment.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>Based on this data, we made some iterations in the final designs focusing on the mode of the assessment.</p>

    <section class="section-five">
        <p class="section-title margin">Designing the career assessment Experience</p>
        <p>Using the feedback on the length of the assessment and the type of questions, we reflected on the process of coming up with the questions which were originally gathering questions from other assessments. We modified this by researching major tech careers and identifying personality traits and skills peculiar to each of the careers, we then curated concise questions that helped us identify and match users to the careers that are the best fit for them.</p>
        <div class="image-container"><img src="./images/radicalX/Assessment_questions.png" alt=""></div>
        <p>One of our major goals for the UI design was to create an engaging and tailored experience for each category of the audience. We created a clean and modern design that onboards the user on the purpose of the assessment and the process.</p>

        <p class="section-title margin">Utilizing Design systems and Style guide</p>
        <p>Before creating the High fidelity design, we created systems to help speed up our design process considering the time constraints. We used RadicalX brand assets and a design system which we modified to fit our overall design direction.</p>
        <div class="image-container"><img src="./images/radicalX/style-guide.png" alt=""></div>
        <p>To begin, we used RadicalX's primary color- green- to fit into the brand, but we discovered that the use was overwhelming for users, so we changed the primary color to shades of blue to create a calming effect and an overall clean and modern design that helps users easily achieve their goal without being overwhelmed. I oversaw the process of revising the initial designs.</p>

        <p class="section-pretitle margin">Final designs</p>
        <p class="section-title">Getting Started on the assessment</p>
        <div class="gif-container"><img src="./images/radicalX/RadicalX Preview X Getting Started on the assessment.gif" alt=""></div>
        <p>A new user getting on the website is trying to understand what the career assessment is about, and how it helps them identify their possible career.</p>
        <p>The landing page informs them on the purpose of the assessment, how it works, they can easily get started on the assessment as it is the primary call to action.</p>
        <p>They could also get signed up to save their results and information for future reference.</p>
        
        <p class="section-title margin">The Refined Career Assessment Experience</p>
        <div class="gif-container"><img src="./images/radicalX/RadicalX_The Refined Career Assessment Experience.gif" alt=""></div>
        <p>People at different stages of their careers trying to transition or get started in tech have had different work journeys with transferable skills. The usual career assessment process is usually long, boring, and not tailored to the user’s journey.</p>
        <p>We aimed at creating a calming and engaging assessment experience, tailored to each person’s career stage and that’s why it is designed in an engaging way using visual elements like gifs and images that excite the users.</p>
        <p>We also have the assessment broken into 3 sections in which users can save their progress for later and also view their progress through the progress bar for each section.</p>
        
        <p class="section-title margin">Viewing the results</p>
        <div class="gif-container"><img src="./images/radicalX/RadicalX_Viewing the results.gif" alt=""></div>
        <p>Discovering a new possible career path can be daunting without proper context and information supporting the result, this was identified from some of of the user interviews we conducted.</p>
        <p>The assessment result shows a range of possible best-fit careers with detailed information on each, we also provide links to resources and the RadicalX virtual internship program to get them started on their career journey.</p>

        <p class="section-title">Design impact.</p>
        <p class="dark-grey">Measured based on initial user feedbacks.</p>
        <p>The product generated a 95% NPS Score, also measured by user reviews and feedback which I got from the second round of usability testing.</p>

        <p class="section-title">Conclusion</p>
        <p>Working on this project as part of a team was an incredible experience; as the team leader, I was able to learn and improve my communication and collaboration skills, as well as understand the process of working with stakeholders at various levels. At the end of my internship, the feature was deemed one of the best approaches and was shipped for further development.</p>
